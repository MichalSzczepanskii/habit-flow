#Application - HabitFlow (MVP)

### Main problem

Maintaining consistency when building new habits is challenging without a clear system to monitor progress. Manual tracking (like paper journals) is often tedious, and the absence of visual "streak" indicators makes it easy for users to quit after the first minor setback.

### Minimum set of functionalities

- Habit Management (CRUD): Saving, reading, editing, and deleting daily habits.
- User Authentication: A simple account system to link users with their personal habit lists and progress history.
- Daily Check-ins: A mechanism to mark a habit as "completed" for the current day.
- Streak Logic: Core business logic that automatically calculates the current streak (number of consecutive days completed) for each habit.
- Daily Progress Summary: A visual indicator (e.g., a progress bar) showing the percentage of the day's total tasks that have been completed.

### What is NOT in the scope of the MVP

- Advanced Analytics: Long-term historical charts, monthly reports, or PDF exports.
- Automated Reminders: Push notifications or email alerts to remind users to complete their tasks.
- Gamification: Leveling systems, badges, or experience points (XP).
- Social Features: Sharing progress with friends or public leaderboards.

Success criteria

- 80% of users have at least 3 active habits in their personal dashboard.
- 70% of users achieve a streak of 5 or more days within the first two weeks of using the application.
- 60% of users log in daily to mark their completed tasks.
